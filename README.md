# Random Currency Rates Generator
This _command-line_ app is used to generate random exchange rates for unit and load testing purposes in a target KIP Currency Application.

Before you run the app, you would need to: 
        
1. Review the file containing a list of the rate groups. Add and update entries as required.

2. Review the file containing a list of 3-letter ISO currency codes (e.g. GBP, USD, etc). Add and update entries as required.


> **Note** Entries in each of these files must 
> - be on a separate line, 
> - have no trailing or leading spaces or spaces (the rate group entries can have spaces within them but not at the beginning or end)


 >**The data used and generated by this app is purely mock random data and has no bearing on any existing entity, engagement or the company.** 

The main program is in one single python file.
